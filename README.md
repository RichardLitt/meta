### Meta about meta

This is a repository for quickly keeping track of ideas and fostering conversation around them. I've got ideas pouring out of my ears, and some of them are good, some of them aren't. In the past, I've built sites to help with this: [IdeaOtter](http://ideaotter.com), [Ideapod](http://ideapod.com).I used to use a Trello board, [Richard's public ideas](https://trello.com/b/LoZkhd9Y/richard-s-public-ideas). I'm in my Terminal a lot more than Trello, though, and [ghi](https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi) makes it easier to record thoughts here. 

If you like any ideas, please comment on them! If enough people like an idea, I will probably start it. If you want to collaborate on any of them, please get in touch -that is why this is here. With collaboration, I firmly believe we can do anything.
