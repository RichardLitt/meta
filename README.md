## Background

This is a repository for quickly keeping track of my ideas, and for fostering conversation around them.

Ideas about what to build are easy to find. In the past, I've built sites to help with idea generation and collection: [IdeaOtter](http://ideaotter.com), [Ideapod](http://ideapod.com). I used to use a Trello board, [Richard's public ideas](https://trello.com/b/LoZkhd9Y/richard-s-public-ideas). More recently, I'm in my Terminal a lot more than Trello, though, and [ghi](https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi) makes it easier to record thoughts here.

What is difficult is building an idea up into where others can help with it, get on board, share intentionality, and build something together. If you're interested in helping me out, comment in an issue!

If you like any ideas, please comment on them! If enough people like an idea, I will probably start working on it. If you want to collaborate on any of them, please get in touch - that is why this is here.

:fire:
